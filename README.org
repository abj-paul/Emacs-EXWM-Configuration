* About
  A easy but perfectly working EXWM emacs environment
  [[file:demo.png]]
** Installation
   Clone the git repository.
#+begin_src bash
   cd ~/.emacs.d/ && git clone https://github.com/abj-paul/Emacs-EXWM-Configuration/tree/ArchLinuxSystem

   emacs #(Packages will be installed as emacs boots up)
#+end_src
 For EXWM to work, we need to do three things.
 1. Put ~EXWM.desktop~ in /usr/share/xsessions/
 2. Now we need a background for our transparent EXWM. Put your background in /usr/share/backgrounds/derrick-cooper-L505cPnmIds-unsplash.jpg
 3. Install feh, mpv, compton and xss-lock
#+begin_src bash
  cp EXWM.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/
  cp derrick-cooper-L505cPnmIds-unsplash.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds/derrick-cooper-L505cPnmIds-unsplash.jpg

  sudo apt install feh mpv compton xss-lock
#+end_src
* Features
  We do not enable anything by default and we have very few packages here. More package makes it bloated if you dont know how each of them work.
  - The ~config.org~ has good documentation, specially in the packages added later. So to get idea on how a certain package works, do go through that.
  - Enable Semantic mode and flychcker when you are coding.
